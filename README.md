## Project Overview

Med-aphor was inspired by my interest in holistic medicine and goal of taking care of my body. I found myself constantly scouring the web for hours, looking at remedies for certain ailments from fatigue to insomnia to a simple cold and flu. I love learning about at-home remedies and my health is my top priority. Thanks to the wonderful Metaphor API and help of OpenAI's API, I was able to streamline this process and view in-depth summaries and reccomendations from the latest medical journals with a single button and prompt.
